        <h2>Article on Time Needed to Decompose</h2>
        <p><a href="https://chariotenergy.com/blog/how-long-until-plastic-decomposes/">"How Long Does It Take Plastic To Decompose?"</a> by Chariot Energy answer common questions that we might have around plastic decomposition aiming to educate the general public. The website is text-heavy without any interactions except the FRQ dropdowns. I also liked that they have a chart of the different materials and years needed to decompose that material. I believe it would also be important to bring solutions to plastic.</p>

        <h2>Interactive Website</h2>
        <p>This <a href="https://www.unep.org/interactives/beat-plastic-pollution/">website</a> from the UN environment programee aims to educate people on the decomposition and our reliance on one-time use plastic. The website brings a scrollable experience that educates the user through informative text, illustrations, and numbers. It also give solutions to users such as using plastic alternatives and cleaning green spaces. It uses a similar expereince that I am trying to achieve with my website which is a scrollable expereince. However, I want to bring more narrative into my website and expand on the scale of time.</p>
